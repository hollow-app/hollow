# L1
- [x] the form ui is trash, opt global.css.
- [ ] the creation of a theme should have an option to select some predefined themes, and in the settings should have the predefined themes and the ability to edit them.
- [?] popup for uploading files, which should display more informations about the files imported.
- [?] toolsettings and formpop have similar components, could also repeate in future component.
- [ ] clean the manipulation files, those might not be needed.
- [ ] the Editor might not be functioning good the top level signal was weird, the call of the editor is also weird, it's taking a the long way.
# L2
- [ ] code themes should only include 2 themes. others can be downloaded once the user selects them.

# BUGS

- [x] the emoji and the tool info in the expanded panel are above the settings window!
