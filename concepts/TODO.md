# S
- [x] each card needs an id key and use it instead of card name, and maybe include with it more options like emoji... in the onLoad props.

# L1
- [x] the form ui is trash, opt global.css.
- [-] the creation of a theme (p/s colors) should have an option to select some predefined themes, and in the settings should have the predefined themes and the ability to edit them.
- [x] popup for uploading files, which should display more informations about the files imported.
- [x-x] toolsettings and formpop have similar components, could also repeate in future component.
- [x] clean the manipulation files, those might not be needed.
- [x] the Editor might not be functioning good the top level signal was weird, the call of the editor is also weird, it's taking a the long way.
- [ ] the secondary/p colors going to cause a problem when selector is opened mid realm. the best option is making the selector async and setColors to the predefined theme for selector.
- [ ] filter component[s] might be replaced with dropdown.
# L2
- [x] code themes should only include 2 themes. others can be downloaded once the user selects them.
- [x] replace certain types with hollow-api.d.ts file.
- [x] opt
- [x] IPlugin needs to have tha api instance passed to it using a constr or an initialize fun
- [x] rich dropdown menu, by default sorted items (no input), items include groups, items can be checked which means onSelect in this case has no use.
# BUGS

- [x] the emoji and the tool info in the expanded panel are above the settings window!
